# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe is a pencil and paper game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a 3 X 3 grid, generally with 'X' and 'O'. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the game. I have created this game's virtual mode to let people enjoy with their mates. Have a chance and see who wins...

E.g. -

 O O X
 X O O
-X-X-X-
